//! Platform traits and per-OS backends.
//!
//! # Layout
//!
//! - One trait per concern, each in its own module: [`Displays`], [`Capture`],
//!   [`WindowList`], [`Hotkeys`], [`StatusItem`], [`Clipboard`], [`FileDialogs`],
//!   [`OverlayWindowStyle`], [`Permissions`].
//! - One backend directory per platform — `macos/`, `windows/`, `linux/x11/`,
//!   `linux/wayland/` — with **one file per trait** (`displays.rs`, `capture.rs`,
//!   `window_list.rs`, `hotkeys.rs`, `status_item.rs`, `clipboard.rs`,
//!   `dialogs.rs`, `overlay_style.rs`, `permissions.rs`), so parallel tracks never
//!   edit the same file. Each file exports one type with an infallible `new()`;
//!   the directory's `mod.rs` assembles them into a [`Platform`] and never needs
//!   to change.
//!
//! Backends that are not implemented yet fail every call with
//! [`Error::Unsupported`](chartreuse_core::Error::Unsupported), so every target
//! compiles and the app can report the gap instead of crashing.
//!
//! # Threading
//!
//! On macOS, iced/winit owns the main thread and its run loop. iced's `boot`,
//! `update`, and `view` — and the callback of `iced::window::run` — execute on that
//! thread; `Task` futures and `Subscription` streams execute on a thread pool.
//!
//! - Call every trait method from `boot` or `update` (the main thread). Several
//!   require it (`NSStatusItem`, Carbon hotkeys, `NSScreen`, `NSOpenPanel`).
//! - Do AppKit UI setup — [`StatusItem::install`], and anything else that needs
//!   the running `NSApplication` run loop — in `update`, never in `boot`: iced
//!   0.14 calls `boot` before the event loop starts. To do it at startup, have
//!   `boot` return `Task::done` with an install message (for the tray,
//!   `Task::done(Message::Tray(tray::Message::Install))`) and install when
//!   `update` receives it; tasks from `boot` are delivered only once the event
//!   loop is running.
//! - Slow operations (capture, window enumeration, dialogs) return a
//!   `BoxFuture<'static, _>` that is `Send`: start them in `update` and hand the
//!   future to `Task::perform`. The backend itself hops to whatever thread its OS
//!   API needs.
//! - [`OverlayWindowStyle::apply`] runs inside the `iced::window::run` callback,
//!   which is on the main thread but must be `Send`, so that trait is
//!   `Send + Sync` and held in an [`Arc`].
//! - Registrations ([`event::Registration`]) are `!Send` and are dropped on the
//!   main thread along with the app state.
//!
//! # Event delivery
//!
//! Sources of spontaneous events — [`StatusItem`] menu choices and [`Hotkeys`]
//! presses — hand back an [`event::EventReceiver`] together with a
//! [`event::Registration`]:
//!
//! 1. In `update` (at startup, via a message from `boot`; see
//!    [Threading](#threading)), call [`StatusItem::install`] or
//!    [`Hotkeys::register`]. Store the returned handle (receiver + registration)
//!    in the feature's state.
//! 2. The OS callback, on the main thread, pushes each event through the
//!    backend's [`event::EventSender`] without blocking.
//! 3. The feature's `subscription()` turns the stored receiver into an iced
//!    `Subscription` with the app crate's `events::subscription(&receiver)`, which
//!    keys the subscription on the receiver's identity, so it lives exactly as
//!    long as the receiver stays in the state.
//! 4. Dropping the handle (for example to re-register hotkeys) unregisters with the
//!    OS and ends the subscription.
