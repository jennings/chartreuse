//! Wayland: privacy permissions. Screen capture goes through the Screenshot
//! portal, which asks the user itself when Chartreuse captures (and remembers
//! the answer per app), so there is nothing to check or request beforehand:
//! the status is reported as granted, and a refusal surfaces as the capture
//! failing with [`Error::PermissionDenied`](chartreuse_core::Error). Where the
//! answer is kept depends on the desktop (GNOME: Settings → Apps), so there is
//! no settings page to open.
