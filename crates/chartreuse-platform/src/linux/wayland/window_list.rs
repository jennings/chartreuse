//! Wayland: window enumeration, which Wayland does not offer. Clients see only
//! their own windows (the protocol has no global window list, and the
//! compositor-specific ones, such as wlr-foreign-toplevel, carry no
//! geometry), so window selection over a frozen screenshot is impossible.
//! Window capture instead goes through the Screenshot portal's own window
//! picker (see [`WaylandCapture`](super::capture::WaylandCapture)).
