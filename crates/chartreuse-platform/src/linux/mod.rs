//! Linux and other free Unix desktops: an X11 and a Wayland backend, chosen at
//! runtime from the session type.
//!
//! Both backends share the tray ([`tray`], a StatusNotifierItem), the file
//! dialogs ([`file_chooser`], the FileChooser portal), and the clipboard
//! ([`clipboard`]). The backends' pure logic lives in [`logic`], which uses
//! no Linux-only crate: test builds on other hosts compile it (and the session
//! detection here), so its unit tests run on every development machine.
//!
//! # Limitations
//!
//! Known from the protocols and libraries the backends use; not yet checked
//! on every desktop.
//!
//! - Tray: needs a StatusNotifierItem host. KDE Plasma, Xfce, Cinnamon, MATE,
//!   LXQt, Budgie, and Waybar have one; GNOME needs the AppIndicator
//!   extension. There is no fallback to the older XEmbed tray.
//! - X11 scaling: the desktop has one scale factor (`Xft.dpi`, as every
//!   major desktop sets it). Without a DPI setting winit derives a factor per
//!   monitor from its physical size; the display model then uses the primary
//!   monitor's for all, and overlays on monitors whose factor differs are
//!   misplaced.
//! - X11 window capture: without a compositing manager, a window is read
//!   from the screen, so whatever covers it is captured too.
//! - Wayland overlays: winit offers no layer-shell, so the platform crate
//!   cannot put overlays above other windows (see [`wayland`]'s overlay
//!   style); they open as ordinary windows.
//! - Wayland windows: clients cannot list other clients' windows, so window
//!   selection fails; window capture is the Screenshot portal's interactive
//!   picker, which the app's window mode (listing windows first) does not
//!   reach yet.
//! - Wayland screen capture: needs the Screenshot portal (GNOME, KDE, or
//!   xdg-desktop-portal-wlr on wlroots compositors), whose first use asks the
//!   user. The screenshot is assumed to cover the logical layout at one scale,
//!   as GNOME's and grim's do.
//! - Wayland hotkeys: need the GlobalShortcuts portal (GNOME 48 and later,
//!   KDE Plasma, Hyprland; not xdg-desktop-portal-wlr), which may ask the user
//!   to confirm or change the triggers. Failures are only logged.
//! - Wayland clipboard: the data-control protocols (KDE, wlroots); on GNOME
//!   through XWayland.
