/// How an annotation is drawn. Every annotation carries a full `Style`; each
/// kind reads the fields that apply to it (text ignores `stroke_width`, strokes
/// ignore `font_size`), so restyling a mixed selection is uniform.
///
/// Lengths are in base-image pixels, like all document coordinates. They should
/// be finite and positive; geometry treats non-positive values as zero.
///
/// # Strokes
///
/// Every stroke (a line, an arrow's shaft, a rectangle's outline) is
/// `stroke_width` wide, centered on the annotation's geometry, with **round
/// caps and round joins**: it covers exactly the points within
/// `stroke_width / 2` of the stroked path. Filled parts (an arrowhead) are
/// filled only, never stroked, so their corners stay sharp.
///
/// This is the editor's one stroke geometry. The model's hit areas and bounds
/// are derived from it, and the canvas and flatten must draw it, so what the
/// user sees, clicks, selects, and exports agree.
