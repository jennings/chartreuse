//! Annotation kinds, their geometry, and hit-testing.

//! # Adding a kind
//!
//! Each kind is a struct plus a [`Shape`] variant. Adding one means a new
//! struct, a new variant, and one arm in each `match` in [`Shape`]'s methods;
//! the compiler lists every other place (canvas, flatten) that must learn to
//! draw it. Nothing in the document or undo machinery is kind-specific
//! except text measurement and step numbering.
//!
//! Step markers do not store their number: it is derived from the document
//! ([`Document::step_number`](super::Document::step_number): the 1-based rank
//! of the marker's [`AnnotationId`] among the step markers still present),
//! so deleting or restoring a marker renumbers the rest for free. Ids
//! increase in creation order and are never reused, and undo restores the
//! original id, so that rank is stable under reordering and undo.
