//! The document model: base image, ordered annotations, selection, and
//! command-based undo/redo. Pure logic. Owned by track 1G.
//!
//! # Coordinate space
//!
//! Everything in the model is in **base-image pixel coordinates**, as `f32`:
//! the origin is the top-left corner of the base image, `x` grows right, `y`
//! grows down, and one unit is one pixel of the base image (not a logical
//! point, and independent of the editor's zoom). Coordinates are continuous and
//! may fall outside the image; flattening clips to the image.
//!
//! The canvas maps between widget and document space with its own zoom/pan
//! transform, and must scale screen-space quantities (such as a hit-test
//! tolerance of a few logical points) into document units before calling the
//! model.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! - [`Document`] owns the base image, the [`Annotation`]s in z-order (index 0
//!   at the bottom), the selection, and the undo history.
//! - An [`Annotation`] is a stable [`AnnotationId`], a [`Shape`] (one variant
//!   per kind: [`Line`], [`Arrow`], [`Rectangle`], [`Text`]) and a [`Style`].
//! - Edits go through [`Document::add`] and [`Document::apply`] with a
//!   [`Command`]; each is one undo step, and no-ops are not recorded.
//! - [`Document::annotation_at`] finds the topmost annotation under a point;
//!   [`Shape::hit`] documents the hit area of each kind.
//!
//! The module docs at the top of `model/annotation.rs` and `model/history.rs`
//! describe how 3B's kinds (step markers with derived numbering, blur regions,
//! and so on) and the document-level crop slot in.
