//! The tool framework and one module per annotation tool. The Stage 3 tools
//! add their own modules here.
//!
//! # How a tool works
//!
//! The [`Editor`](crate::Editor) owns one active [`Tool`] and feeds it
//! [`Pointer`] events already converted to document coordinates, together
//! with a [`Context`]: the document to edit, the style for new annotations,
//! and the current zoom (so screen-space slop such as [`HIT_TOLERANCE`] can be
//! converted to document units). A tool is a small state machine:
//!
//! - It keeps an in-progress gesture (a drag) to itself and describes it with
//!   [`Tool::preview`], which the canvas draws on top of the document.
//! - It commits a finished gesture to the document as exactly one undo step
//!   (one [`Document::add`] or [`Document::apply`]).
//! - [`Tool::escape`] abandons the gesture (the Escape key) and
//!   [`Tool::finish`] completes it early (switching tools).
//!
//! Tools are pure logic over the model: they never touch the renderer, so they
//! are tested by feeding them events.
//!
//! # Adding a tool
//!
//! Add a module with the tool type, a [`ToolKind`] variant, and an arm in
//! [`ToolKind::create`]. Tools that draw a shape by dragging from one corner
//! or end to the other only need a [`DragShape`] (see `line.rs`).
