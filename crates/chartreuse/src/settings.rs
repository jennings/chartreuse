//! The settings window (`WindowKind::Settings`), and keeping [`App::config`]
//! in step with the settings file. Owned by track 3A.
//!
//! # The window
//!
//! The status item's Settings item ([`Message::Open`]) opens the window, or
//! brings it to the front if it is already open: there is at most one. Every
//! change applies at once, to [`App::config`], and is saved.
//!
//! - **Hotkeys**: a recorder per capture mode. Clicking one records: the next
//!   key combination with Ctrl, Alt or Super (Command on macOS) becomes the
//!   mode's hotkey, keys being taken by their position on the keyboard.
//!   Escape, clicking the recorder again, or leaving the window cancels. The
//!   app's hotkeys are unregistered while it records, so that their
//!   combinations reach the window. A combination another mode has is
//!   rejected with a line saying so, and recording goes on. A combination the
//!   system or another program holds is kept, but the line under it says it
//!   is not active, as for any registration failure (from
//!   `hotkeys::State::problem`, so failures at startup show too). Default puts
//!   back the mode's default hotkey.
//! - **After a capture**: open the editor, copy the capture, or save and copy
//!   it ([`AfterCapture`], applied by the capture flow).
//! - **Saving**: the folder saves go to, typed as a full path or one starting
//!   with `~` ([`SaveDirectory`]), or left empty for the default; the
//!   platform's file dialogs cannot choose a folder. Then the file name
//!   pattern ([`FileNamePattern`]), with a preview of the name a capture taken
//!   now would get. Text that is not valid says why under its field and
//!   changes nothing until it is.
//!
//! ## Adding a setting
//!
//! Each row of the window is a `setting` (a label and a control) in a
//! `section` of [`view`], and every change goes through `change`, which
//! applies it and saves it. A change is a function of the settings, so that
//! it can be made again on top of a file edited by hand (see
//! [Saving](self#saving)). So a new setting takes a [`Message`] variant, an
//! [`update`] arm, and a row. For example, a toggle in a new section:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! // In `update`:
//! Message::LaunchAtLogin(on) => change(app, move |config| config.launch_at_login = on),
//! // In `view`:
//! section("General", [setting(
//!     "Launch at login",
//!     toggler(app.config.launch_at_login)
//!         .on_toggle(|on| AppMessage::Settings(Message::LaunchAtLogin(on))),
//! )]),
//! ```
//!
//! # Saving
//!
//! Changes are saved off the main thread by syncing with the file: it is
//! loaded, the changes made in the window since the last sync are made again
//! on top of what it holds, the result is written
//! ([`chartreuse_config::save`]), and it becomes [`App::config`], with the
//! changes made meanwhile on top. So a hand edit the watcher has not seen yet
//! is kept, not overwritten, and the settings in memory are always those in
//! the file plus the changes still to save. Loading the file after a hand
//! edit (below) is a sync with no changes, and there is one sync at a time: a
//! change or hand edit that comes during a sync is synced once it ends.
//!
//! A sync that fails (say, the file was edited into invalid TOML) is reported
//! once per problem, like a hand edit that does not load, and shown at the
//! bottom of the window. The changes still apply, and are saved by the next
//! sync: the next change, or the hand edit that fixes the file.
//!
//! # Picking up hand edits
//!
//! [`App::boot`] loads the settings file ([`chartreuse_config::settings_path`])
//! into [`App::config`]. The file is meant to be edited by hand too, so while
//! the app runs [`subscription`] checks it every [`POLL_INTERVAL`] on a thread
//! of its own. When it changed, it is loaded again off the main thread and
//! applied: [`App::config`] is replaced, and the hotkeys are re-registered if
//! they changed (failures are reported as at startup). A file that no longer
//! loads (invalid TOML or an invalid setting) leaves the settings as they
//! were and is reported, once per problem: the same problem is not reported
//! again until the file loads or a different problem turns up. Deleting the
//! file means the defaults, as at startup.
//!
//! The check compares the file's modification time and size with those it
//! had when the app last read or wrote it. Polling, rather than file system
//! notifications (the `notify` crate), because saves replace the file by
//! renaming another over it (ours, and many editors'), which a watch on the
//! file itself loses track of, and its directory may not exist yet: one
//! `stat` every two seconds handles all of that, on every platform, without a
//! dependency.
