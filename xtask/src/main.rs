Usage: cargo xtask <command>

Commands:
  check     cargo fmt --check, cargo clippy (warnings denied), cargo test
  bundle    build and sign target/debug/Chartreuse Dev.app (macOS); signs with
            $CHARTREUSE_SIGN_IDENTITY, else the dev-cert identity, else ad-hoc
            with a warning
  run       bundle, then launch the app with `open`, its output on this terminal
            --fake  use the synthetic platform backend: no real capture, and no
                    macOS privacy prompts (use this for automated work)
  dev-cert  create a self-signed development signing identity in its own
            keychain (macOS, once per machine), so the Screen Recording
            permission survives rebuilds
  release   release build for this OS, archived into target/dist (emptied
            first) as Chartreuse-<version>-<os>-<arch>: on macOS a zipped
            release-flavor Chartreuse.app signed with
            $CHARTREUSE_RELEASE_SIGN_IDENTITY; on Windows (.zip) and Linux
            (.tar.gz) the executable with LICENSE and README.md
            --allow-ad-hoc  macOS: sign ad-hoc when the identity is unset; the
                            archive name ends in -unsigned
  upload-release <tag>
            attach every file in target/dist to the GitHub release <tag>
            (v<version>, matching Cargo.toml) with the GitHub CLI, replacing
            assets of the same name; needs GH_TOKEN and, outside a git
            checkout, GH_REPO=owner/repo
